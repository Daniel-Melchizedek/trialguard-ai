# Trial Guard — AI‑powered free‑trial companion & autonomous canceller

> **Trial Guard** detects free‑trial sign‑ups as you browse — analyzing page content **100% on‑device** with [**Aion‑1.0‑Instruct**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/web-platform/prompt-api#the-aion-10-instruct-model) — **Microsoft's** on‑device small language model (SLM) on Windows — then sends you a daily **AI‑generated tip** so you get full value from every day of your trial. If you ever decide the trial isn't for you, Trial Guard can **autonomously cancel** the subscription on your behalf — no hunting through settings, no surprise charges.
>
> **Theme: Agentic Web** — an agent that watches your browsing, understands intent with on‑device AI, and takes real action on your behalf.

## 1. Project Description

Free trials are packed with value — but only if you use them. Trial Guard helps you get the most from every trial day with AI‑generated tips, and if you decide it's not the right fit, can cancel the subscription autonomously on your behalf:

- **Detect** — As you browse, the Edge extension reads the page on‑device with **Aion‑1.0‑Instruct** (Edge Prompt API `LanguageModel`) and decides whether you've started a time‑limited *free trial* (vs a permanent free plan), extracting the product name and end date. Your full page content never leaves the device — only a small set of extracted metadata is sent to the backend (see [§8 Data Privacy](#8-data-privacy)).
- **Maximise your trial** — An Azure Functions backend stores the trial and emails you a daily **AI‑generated tip** — grounded in live web context — to help you discover features and get full value from the product throughout the trial period. Each email also includes a countdown and a "Manage subscription" link so you're always in control.
- **Cancel autonomously, if you choose** — From the popup you launch a **side‑panel agent** that opens the product's account page and works through the cancellation flow on its own: *observe the page → ask Aion for the next action → click/select → repeat*. It chooses survey reasons, declines retention offers ("No thanks"), and **pauses for you to type your password** (it never auto‑fills credentials). You can hit **Stop** at any time.

A bundled **sample web app ("Neuro Revive")** is included so you can test **trial activation and cancellation through the extension without signing up for any real trials that require payment information** — no real product, no credit card, fully repeatable.

## 2. Innovation

| What | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| **On‑device trial detection with Aion‑1.0‑Instruct** | Page content is classified entirely inside Microsoft Edge using the new Edge Prompt API (`LanguageModel`). No cloud round‑trip for detection — zero latency, full privacy. |
| **Same on‑device SLM, two agentic tasks** | Aion‑1.0‑Instruct drives both trial detection (page classification) and autonomous cancellation (choosing UI actions from an accessibility tree) — demonstrating versatile on‑device agentic reasoning with a single model. |
| **Universal autonomous cancellation** | Rather than hardcoding cancellation flows for specific websites, the agent observes the live accessibility tree, asks Aion for the next action, and executes it — making it work on any website without site‑specific code. |
| **Hybrid on‑device + cloud AI pipeline** | Detection and cancellation use on‑device Aion (zero latency, full privacy); email tip generation uses **Azure AI Foundry Agents v2** with live web search grounding (`gpt‑4o‑mini` + `web_search_preview`) — each task uses the right compute for the job. |
| **Agentic Web architecture** | The extension embodies the Agentic Web theme: it watches your browsing, understands intent with on‑device AI, and takes real‑world action on your behalf — all from a single click, with a human‑in‑the‑loop password gate to protect credentials. |

## 3. Benefits

### For users

| Benefit | How |
|---|---|
| **Maximise every trial day** | Daily AI‑generated tips (grounded in live web context) help you discover features and get real value before the trial expires. |
| **Peace of mind** | Automatic on‑device detection means you are always aware of active trials — no more forgotten sign‑ups turning into unexpected charges. |
| **Effortless cancellation, when you want it** | One click starts an agent that navigates the cancellation flow autonomously — no hunting through account settings, no missed deadlines. |
| **Privacy by default** | Your browsing is analyzed entirely on‑device; only a small set of extracted metadata ever reaches the cloud (see [§8 Data Privacy](#8-data-privacy)). |
| **Works on any website** | The cancellation agent is not tied to a list of supported services — it can navigate any website's cancellation flow using live page context. |

### For trial product companies

| Benefit | How |
|---|---|
| **Higher trial‑to‑paid conversion** | Users who receive daily AI‑generated tips learn the product more deeply during the trial, increasing the likelihood they see its value and choose to subscribe. |
| **More trial sign‑ups** | Users who know they can cancel effortlessly are more willing to start trials — removing the fear of being locked in or forgetting to cancel. |
| **Fewer chargebacks and disputes** | Users who are reminded throughout the trial and can cancel easily are less likely to dispute charges, reducing support costs and payment processor friction. |
| **Stronger brand trust** | Offering a Trial Guard‑friendly experience signals that a product is confident in its value and respects user autonomy. |

## 8. Data Privacy

### On‑device processing

All page content is read and classified entirely on‑device by **Aion‑1.0‑Instruct** running inside Microsoft Edge. No page text, HTML, or screenshots are ever transmitted to Trial Guard's backend or any external service.

### Metadata collected and stored in Cosmos DB

| Field | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `productName` | Name of the detected product or service | Identify the trial; shown in reminder emails |
| `trialEndDate` / `trialDurationDays` | Trial expiry date or length in days | Calculate when to send daily reminders and the 3‑day pre‑expiry alert |
| `websiteUrl` | URL of the page where the trial was detected | Provide context in reminder emails |
| `pageTitle` | Title of that page | Provide context in reminder emails |
| `userEmail` | Email address entered in the extension's Settings page | Send daily reminder emails; never shared with third parties |
| `detectedAt` | Timestamp of when the trial was first detected | Determine the trial timeline and reminder schedule |

If you choose to cancel a trial, the following additional fields are written to the same record:

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `cancellationStatus` | Track whether cancellation is in progress, succeeded, or failed |
| `cancellationStartedAt` / `cancellationCompletedAt` | Record the cancellation timeline |
| `cancellationError` | Capture any error message if cancellation does not complete |

### What is never collected

- Full page content, HTML, or screenshots
- Browsing history beyond the detected trial page
- Passwords or credentials — the cancellation agent always pauses and waits for you to type these manually; they are never read, stored, or transmitted
